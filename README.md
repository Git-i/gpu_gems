## About

A project **attempting** to implement the entire of [GPU Gems Part 1](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems), it's not much right now

## Why?

This project was created in attempt to get better at graphics programming, rust and vulkan

## Completion Status

| **Chapter**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Status** | **Notes** |
